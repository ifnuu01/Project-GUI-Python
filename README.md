This program is a project program that I created while learning Tkinter

Where this project contains doctor data and patient data management
Doctor data consists of :
-Name
-specialist
-address
-telephone number

Patient data consists of :
-Name
-Address
-Telephone Number
-Complaints

where the data is stored in a sqlite database using the sqlite3 library so that the data is stored dynamically

In the apk folder there is a file apk_RS.exe that is an EXE application generated from the pyinstaller library so you don't need to run the program code, you only need to run the exe file, then the application will run. Make sure database_rumahsakit.db is with apk_RS.exe in the folder so that the application runs normally
